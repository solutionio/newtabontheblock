new tab on the block
================

### I've heard there is a new tab on the block! What's all that fuzz about?
	Yeah, you heard right, there's a new tab on the block. It's super social, so it
	likes to talk to as many APIs as possible. Currently, it can only talk to chrome's
	local bookmarks API.

### Install as Chrome Extension in 3 steps
	1. [click this link](chrome://extensions/)
	2. check the "Developer Mode" Box in the top right corner
	3. click "Load unpackaged extension" and choose this repo's root folder
	
	**your tab is now the new one on the block**

### Contribute
	1. get [node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org)
	2. run `npm install`
	3. run `bower install`

### What is needed
	* whichever bookmarking service you'd like to see
	* a lot of ux and ui work needs to be done. basically it should look and work like tweetdeck
	* a persistent data layer is needed
